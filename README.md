## 1. Cut the clutter

### 1.1. Dead weight words and phrases

Dead weight words and phrases should be removed directly. Instead, give references.

For example,

```
As it is well known
As it has been shown
It can be regarded that
It should be emphasized that
```

should be replaced by references.

### 1.2. Empty words and phrases

Empty words and phrases should be removed directly, because they convey no information.

For example,

```
basic tenets of
methodological
important
```

should be removed directly.

### 1.3. Long words or phrases that could be short

Long words or phrases can always be converted to short words. 

| Wrong                        | Right |
| :--------------------------- | :---- |
| based on the assumption that | if    |

### 1.4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms

Too many jargons/acronyms slow down the readers.

| Wrong | Right     |
| :---- | :-------- |
| miR   | micro RNA |

### 1.5. Repetitive words or phrases

Repetitive words or phrases should be compressed into a single word.

For example, only one word should be left for each of the following tuples:

```
studies/examples
illustrate/demonstrate
challenges/difficulties
successful solutions
```

### 1.6. Generic adverbs

Generic adverbs should never exist in the scientific paper.

For example,

```
very
really
quite
basically
generally
```

should be removed directly.

### 1.7. Eliminate negatives

Negatives should be converted to positives.

| Wrong                    | Right       |
| :----------------------- | :---------- |
| Not honest               | dishonest   |
| Not harmful              | safe        |
| Not important            | unimportant |
| Does not have            | lacks       |
| Did not remember         | forgot      |
| Did not pay attention to | ignored     |
| Did not succeed          | failed      |


### 1.8. Eliminate superfluous uses of "there is/are"

All "There is/are" should be removed.

- **Examples**

```
There are many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys.
There was a long line of bacteria on the plate.
There are many physicists who like to write.
The data confirm that there is an association between vegetables and cancer.
```

should be replaced by

```
We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.
Bacteria lined the plate.
Many physicists like to write.
The data confirm an association between vegetables and cancer.
```

### 1.9. Omit needless propositions

All needless propositions should be removed.

e.g. "on" and "that" are often superfluous.

- **Examples**

```
The meeting happened on Monday.
They agreed that it was true.
```

should be replaced by

```
The meeting happened Monday.
They agreed it was true.
```


## 2. Use active voice

### 2.0 Active voice and passive voice

Active voice:

```
She throws a ball.
```

- She: **agent**
- throws: **verb**
- the ball: **recipient**

Passive voice:

```
The ball is thrown by her.
```

- The ball: **recipient**
- is thrown: **verb**
- her: **agent**

Using active voice is more direct.

Reasons to use active voice:

- **Active voice emphasizes author responsibility.**
  
  > No attempt **was made** to contact non-responders because they **were deemed** unimportant to the analysis.

  should be

  > **We did not attempt** to contact non-responders because **we deemed** them unimportant to the analysis.

- **Active voice improves readability.**
  
  > A strong correlation **was found** between use of the passive voice and other sins of writing.
  
  should be

  > **We found** a strong correlation between use of passive voice and other sins of writing.

- **Active voice reduces ambiguity.**

  > General dysfunction of the immune system at the leukocyte level **is suggested by** both animal and human studies.

  should be

  > Both human and animal studies **suggest** that **diabetics** have general immune dysfunction at the leukocyte level.

Passive voice should be used **sparingly and purposefully**.

- e.g. What is done is more important than who did it.

### 2.1. It’s OK to use "We" and "I"

Reasons:

- The active voice is livelier and easier to read.
- Avoiding personal pronouns **does not** make your science more objective.
- By agreeing to be an author on the paper, you are taking responsibility for its content. Thus, you should also claim responsibility for the assertions in the text by using “We” or “I”.


### 2.2. Use strong verbs

All "to be" verbs and weak verbs should be replaced by more informative words.

"To be" verbs:

```
is, are, was, were, be, been, am, ...
```

Weak verbs:

```
come, move, report, provide, ...
```

- **Examples**

> Loud music **came** from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena **moved** as the hungry crowd got to its feet.

should be

> Loud music **exploded** from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena **shook** as the hungry crowd leaped to its feet.

and

> The WHO **reports that approximately** two-thirds of the world’s diabetics are found in developing countries, and **estimates** that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.

should be

> The WHO **estimates** that two-thirds of the world’s diabetics are found in developing countries, and **projects** that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.

### 2.3. Avoid turning verbs into nouns

Don’t kill verbs by turning them into nouns.

| Wrong                              | Right                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Obtain estimates of                | estimates              |
| Has seen an expansion in           | has expanded           |
| Provides a methodological emphasis | emphasizes methodology |
| Take an assessment of              | assess                 |
| provide a review of                | review                 |
| offer confirmation of              | confirm                |
| make a decision                    | decide                 |
| shows a peak                       | peak                   |
| provide a description of           | describe               |

- **Examples**

> During DNA damage, **recognition** of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in **recruitment** of Sin3/HDAC and **repression** of cell proliferation genes.

should be

> During DNA damage, H3K4me3 **recruits** ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together **repress** cell proliferation genes.

### 2.4. Don’t bury the main verb

Keep the subject and main verb (predicate) close together at the start of the sentence.

Readers are waiting for the verb!

- **Examples**


```
One study ... (long sentence) found that ...
```

should be

```
One study found that, ...
```

## 3. Paragraph editing

### 3.1. Punctuation

Increasing power to separate:

- **low**
- Comma `,`
- Colon `:`
- Dash `-`
- Parentheses `()`
- Semicolon `;`
- Period `.`
- **high**

Notes:

- `,` must follow an incomplete sentence.
- `:`, `-` can follow either complete or incomplete sentences.
- `()`, `;`, `.` should follow complete sentences.

Increasing formality:

- **low**
- Dash `-`
- Parentheses `()`
- The others (Comma `,`, Colon `:`, Semicolon `;`, Period `.`)
- **high**

#### 3.1.1. Semicolon `;`

- The semicolon `;` connects two independent clauses.

(Note that a clause always contains a subject and predicate, and an independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.)

> Kennedy could be a cold and vain man, and he led a life of privilege. But he knew something about the world; he also cared about it.
>
> It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.

- The semicolon `;` separates items in lists that contain internal punctuation (e.g. `,`).

> It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward-looking policies; because people's perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too.

Here `,` can no longer separate the sentences because of internal `,`, so use `;`

#### 3.1.2. Parentheses `()`

- The parentheses `()` inserts an afterthought or explanation (a word, phrase, or sentence) into a passage that is grammatically complete without it.
  - Info in `()` should be additional material.
  - `()` **de-emphasizes** the inner information.
  - If you remove the material within the parentheses, the main point of the sentence **should not change**.
  - Parentheses give the reader permission to **skip over** the material.
  - But it can be a nice detail for readers.

> They also have a specialized tail, kind of like a monkey's tail, that allows them to cling to a piece of grass (or a lucky diver's finger).
>
> This is troubling because, while there are plausible biological stories to connect red meat with cancer and heart disease, it seems unlikely that eating too much red meat could directly cause accidents and injuries. (Unless, as one of my student quipped, red meat eaters are swerving to avoid cows!)

#### 3.1.3 Colon `:`

- Use a colon after an independent clause to **introduce** a
  - list
  - quote
  - explanation
  - conclusion
  - amplification

##### 3.1.3.1. Example of introducing a **list**:

> The hydrogen bonds are made as follows: purine position 1 to pyrimidine position 1; purine position 6 to pyrimidine position 6.

##### 3.1.3.2. Example of **amplifying**

(Here, by using a colon, we're building up the reader's anticipation, we're getting them ready for the punchline.)

> That's one reason why I'm so optimistic about the future: the constant churn of scientific progress.
>
> The woman suffers from lack of experience and a chronic Democratic disease: compound sentences.
>
> Companies use Marsh for the same reason that home sellers use real-estate agents: The agent's knowledge and experience is supposed to help the client get the right deal at the right place.

##### 3.1.3.3. The rule of three's (lists, examples)

When it's arbitrary, **3** is a pleasing number of how many examples you list.

##### 3.1.3.4. Example of misusing `:`:

> Two aspects of alcohol use are related to brain injuries: as a factor associated with risk of an injury such as a motor vehicle crash, and as a factor in TBI diagnosis, recovery, or survival after injury.

Issue:

- The aspects should be nouns, but it starts with `as`.

Refined version:

> Two aspects of alcohol use are related to brain injuries: its association with risk of injury, such as motor vehicle crash, and its post-injury influences on TBI diagnosis, recovery, or survival after injury.

> In one project we have a nutritionist, a psychologist, statisticians, a computer specialist, and dietitians: a whole range of specialties.

Issues:

- Lists and the recipient `a whole range of specialties` are inverse.

Refined version:

> In one project we have a whole range of specialties: a nutritionist, a psychologist, statisticians, a computer specialist, and dietitians.

#### 3.1.4. Dash `-`

Use the dash to add **emphasis** or to insert an **abrupt definition or description** almost **anywhere in the sentence**

Just **don't overuse** it, or it loses its impact.

##### 3.1.4.1. Example of emphasis:

> The drugs did more than prevent new fat accumulation. The also triggered overweight mice to shed significant amounts of fat - up to half their body weight.

- If using `,`, loss of emphasis, more clunky
- If using `()`, it buries the information

##### 3.1.4.2. Example of emphasis and adding information:

> Researchers who study shipworms say these mislabeled animals - they're clams, not worms - are actually a scientific treasure.

- commas aren't strong enough to set off a clause.
- If using `()`, it buries the information

### 3.2. Parallelism

Writing sentences in parallel structures.

Pairs of ideas joined by `and`, `or`, or `but` should be written in parallel form.

- SVX but SVX

> The velocity decreased by 50% but the pressure decreased by only 10%.

- Infinitive phrase and infinitive phrase

> We aimed to increase the resolution and to improve picture quality.

- List of ideas

> Locusts denuded fields in Utah, torrents washed away rural Iowa, and blazing heat shriveled Arizona's cotton.

Parallelism forces you to make a choice of the structure and stick to it.

### 3.3. Paragraphs

- 1 paragraph = 1 idea
- Give away the punch line (conclusion) early
  - "Inverse pyramid style" in Journalism
- Paragraph flow is helped by
  - Logical flow of ideas
  - parallel sentences and structures
  - *if necessary*, transition words
- Make the last sentence memorable
  - Emphasis at the end.
  - Your reader remembers the first sentence and the last sentence best.

#### 3.3.1. Logic flow of ideas

- Sequential in time
  - Avoid the Momento approach!
- General -> specific
  - Take-home message first!
- Logical arguments (if a then b; a; therefore b)

#### 3.3.2. Editing a paragraph

- Outline (What is the paragraph trying to convey?)
  - Main idea of the paragraph
  - Major points / supporting ideas
    - Sub-supporting ideas
  - The target is to bring out all relevant info and get rid of irrelevant info
- Re-organize sentences
  - Boil sentences down to **upshots**
  - Put upshots all togethers
  - Re-order upshots, so that sentences are re-ordered
  - Find and delete irrelevant info
- Sentence-level editing

#### 3.3.3. An example of editing a paragraph


> The concept of chocolate having potential therapeutic benefits for people with diabetes mellitus, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus, presents a number of intellectual challenges, from both clinical and sociological perspectives. It seems almost counterintuitive to suggest an energy-dense food that is high in sugar, and often seen as a treat or a “dietary sin”, could offer such promise. However, a large volume of mechanistic and animal model studies has been undertaken demonstrating the potential benefits of cocoa and chocolate for both glucose regulation and modification of complications associated with diabetes. Cesar Fraga in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition first proposed the potential of chocolate for people with diabetes in 2005. It was suggested that we should consume more cocoa and chocolate to reduce the burdens of hypertension and diabetes.(1) Grassi and colleagues (2) further reinforced this potential for its antihypertensive and insulin-sensitizing effect with the mechanistic data. However, the hypothesis of chocolate having a beneficial effect remains counterintuitive to the average consumer and has yet to gain support among the wider medical and healthcare community.

1. Find the **upshot** for every sentence.

Edited version:

> Many mechanistic and animal studies suggest health benefits for cocoa and chocolate particularly for patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. These studies suggest that cocoa and chocolate can lower blood pressure, improve glucose regulation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce complications from diabetes. But the idea of chocolate is medicine has yet to gain widespread support among consumers or among the wider medical and health care community. It seems counterintuitive that a high sugar energy dense food - one often seen as a treat or dietary sin - could promote health.

### 3.4. Repetition, Keywords and Acronyms

#### 3.4.1. Repetition

It's okay to repeat a word. Sometimes, you do need repeating a word.

- You need to repeat keywords to keep consistent.
  - e.g. name of comparison groups, variables, or instruments

#### 3.4.2. Disastrous Synonyms

Whereas it's just amusing or inelegant in some types of writing, in scientific writing it's a **disaster**.

The reader may think you are referring to a different instrument, model, group, variable, etc.

#### 3.4.3. Acronyms / Initialisms

Diff between acronyms/initialisms

- Acronyms create new words, initialisms just use all first letters.
- Resist the temptation to abbreviate words simply because they occur frequently!
- Use only standard acronyms/initialisms. DON'T make them up!
  - e.g. miR instead of micro RNA
- If you must use acronyms, define them separately in the abstract, each table/figure, and the text. 
  - For long papers, redefine occasionally (as readers don't typically read start to finish).



## 4. Writing Process

### 4.1 Overview of the Writing Process

1. **Prewriting** (70%)
   - Collect, synthesise, and organise info
   - Branstorm take-home messgaes
   - Work out ideas away from the computer
   - Develop a roadmap/outline
2. **Writing the first draft** (10%)
   - Put facts/ideas together in organised prose
3. **Revision** (20%)
   - Read the work out loud
   - Get rid of clutter
   - Do a verb check
   - Get feedback from others

**Bad examples:**
- What will happen if mixing prewriting and writing
  - Write a paragraph, google for data/statistics/..., be distracted from the big picture, and the section ends up with chaos.
- What will happen if mixing writing and revision
  - Be distracted by details and lose big pictures


### 4.2. The Pre-writing Step

#### 4.2.1. Organising info

- Get organised first
  - DON'T try to write and gather info simultaneously
  - Gather and organise info BEFORE writing the first draft
- Have your own organisational system
  1. Read a lot of papers
  2. Write critical info in a single document
  3. Organise them
  4. Have the roadmap of the paper
  5. Develop the roadmap to a more detailed structure

#### 4.2.2. Brainstorm

- Stay away from the computer
- "Write" on the go!
  - When exercising, driving, waiting, multitasking...
- Work out take-home messages
- Organise your paper
- Write memorable lines/words

#### 4.2.3 Compositional organisation

- Similar paragraphs should be grouped/merged
- DON'T "Bait-and-Switch" readers too many times
  - Bait-and-Switch: Argument for A, argument for B, argument for A, ...
  - When discussing a controversy, follow this routine
    1. All arguments
    2. All counter-arguments
    3. All rebuttals


### 4.3. The Writing Step

- DON'T be a perfectionist
- The goal of the first draft is to get the ideas down in complete sentences **in order**
- Focus on logical organisation more than sentence-level details

### 4.4. The Revision Step

#### 4.4.1. Read your work out loud

- Brain processes spoken words different than written words.


#### 4.4.2. Do a verb check

- Lackluster verbs (e.g., is, are)
- Passive verbs (e.g., was observed)
- Buried verbs (e.g., long_subject... verb... )

#### 4.4.3. Cut clutter

- Dead weight words/phrases (e.g., it should be emphasised that...)
- Empty words/phrases (e.g., basic tenets of, important)
- Long words/phrases that can be short
- Unnecessary jargon/acronyms
- Repetitive words/phrases (e.g., teaches clinicians/guides clinicians)
- Adverbs (e.g., very, really, quite, basically)



#### 4.4.4. Do an organisational (high-level) review
- Tag each paragraph with a phrase/sentence summarising the main point
- Move paragraphs abound to improve logical flow and bring similar ideas together


#### 4.4.5. Get feedback from others

- Preferably outside your department
- Without technical background, they should easily grasp
  - main findings
  - take-home messages
  - significance of the work
- Ask them to point out particularly hard-to-read sentences/paragraphs

#### 4.4.6. Get editing help

- Find a good editor to edit your work

### 4.5. Checklist for the final draft

#### 4.5.1. Check for consistency

- Inconsistency
  - Things that are contradictory in different places

#### 4.5.2. Check for numerical consistency

- Do the numbers in the Abstract match the numbers in tables/figures/text?
- DO the numbers in the text match those in the tables/figures?
- Do the numbers in each table/figure match those in other tables/figure?

#### 4.5.3. Check your references

- Do you have "reference to nowhere"?
- Reference does not provide the indicated info/fact, including
  - Authors misinterpreted/exaggerated the findings from the original source
  - Reference cites a secondary source than a primary source (i.e., citation propagation).
  - AUthors mis-numbered the references.

Summary
- Always cite/go back to primary sources!
- Assume that other authors have made errors in citing sources!
