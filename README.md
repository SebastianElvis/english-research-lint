## Table of Contents (TODO)

## 1. Cut the CLutter

### 1.1. Dead weight words and phrases

Dead weight words and phrases should be removed directly. Instead, give references.

For example,

```
As it is well known
As it has been shown
It can be regarded that
It should be emphasized that
```

### 1.2. Empty words and phrases

Empty words and phrases should be removed directly, because they convey no information.

For example,

```
basic tenets of
methodologic
important
```

### 1.3. Long words or phrases that could be short

Long words or phrases can always be converted to short words. 

For example,

```
based on the assumption that
```

should be replaced by

```
if
```

### 1.4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms

Too many jargons/acronyms slow down the readers.

For example,

```
miR
```

should be replaced by

```
micro RNA
```

### 1.5. Repetitive words or phrases

Repetitive words or phrases should be compressed into a single word.

For example, only one word should be left for each of the following tuples:

```
studies/examples
illustrate/demonstrate
challenges/difficulties
successful solutions
```

### 1.6. Generic adverbs

Generic adverbs should never exist in the scientific paper.

For example,

```
very
really
quite
basically
generally
```

### 1.7. Eliminate negatives

Negatives should be converted to positives.

For example,

```
Not honest
Not harmful
Not important
Does not have
Did not remember
Did not pay attention to
Did not succeed
```

should be replaced by

```
dishonest
safe
unimportant
lacks
forgot
ignored
failed
```

### 1.8. Eliminate superfluous uses of "there is/are"

All "There is/are" should be removed.

For example,

```
There are many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys.
There was a long line of bacteria on the plate.
There are many physicists who like to write.
The data confirm that there is an association between vegetables and cancer.
```

should be replaced by

```
We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.
Bacteria lined the plate.
Many physicists like to write.
The data confirm an association between vegetables and cancer.
```

### 1.9. Omit needless propositions

All needless propositions should be removed.

For example, "on" and "that" are often superfluous.

```
The meeting happened on Monday.
They agreed that it was true.
```

should be replaced by

```
The meeting happened Monday.
They agreed it was true.
```
