## 1. Cut the clutter

### 1.1. Dead weight words and phrases

Dead weight words and phrases should be removed directly. Instead, give references.

For example,

```
As it is well known
As it has been shown
It can be regarded that
It should be emphasized that
```

should be replaced by references.

### 1.2. Empty words and phrases

Empty words and phrases should be removed directly, because they convey no information.

For example,

```
basic tenets of
methodologic
important
```

should be removed directly.

### 1.3. Long words or phrases that could be short

Long words or phrases can always be converted to short words. 

| Wrong                        | Right |
| :--------------------------- | :---- |
| based on the assumption that | if    |

### 1.4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms

Too many jargons/acronyms slow down the readers.

| Wrong | Right     |
| :---- | :-------- |
| miR   | micro RNA |

### 1.5. Repetitive words or phrases

Repetitive words or phrases should be compressed into a single word.

For example, only one word should be left for each of the following tuples:

```
studies/examples
illustrate/demonstrate
challenges/difficulties
successful solutions
```

### 1.6. Generic adverbs

Generic adverbs should never exist in the scientific paper.

For example,

```
very
really
quite
basically
generally
```

### 1.7. Eliminate negatives

Negatives should be converted to positives.

| Wrong                    | Right       |
| :----------------------- | :---------- |
| Not honest               | dishonest   |
| Not harmful              | safe        |
| Not important            | unimportant |
| Does not have            | lacks       |
| Did not remember         | forgot      |
| Did not pay attention to | ignored     |
| Did not succeed          | failed      |


### 1.8. Eliminate superfluous uses of "there is/are"

All "There is/are" should be removed.

For example,

```
There are many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys.
There was a long line of bacteria on the plate.
There are many physicists who like to write.
The data confirm that there is an association between vegetables and cancer.
```

should be replaced by

```
We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.
Bacteria lined the plate.
Many physicists like to write.
The data confirm an association between vegetables and cancer.
```

### 1.9. Omit needless propositions

All needless propositions should be removed.

For example, "on" and "that" are often superfluous.

```
The meeting happened on Monday.
They agreed that it was true.
```

should be replaced by

```
The meeting happened Monday.
They agreed it was true.
```


## 2. Use active voice

### 2.0 Active voice and passive voice

Active voice:

```
She throws a ball.
```

- She: **agent**
- throws: **verb**
- the ball: **recipient**

Passive voice:

```
The ball is thrown by her.
```

- The ball: **recipient**
- is thrown: **verb**
- her: **agent**

Using active voice is more direct.

- Active voice emphasizes author responsibility. For example,
  
  > No attempt **was made** to contact non-responders because they **were deemed** unimportant to the analysis.

  should be

  > **We did not attempt** to contact non-responders because **we deemed** them unimportant to the analysis.

- Active voice improves readability
  > A strong correlation **was found** between use of the passive voice and other sins of writing.
  
  should be

  > **We found** a strong correlation between use of passive voice and other sins of writing.

- Active voice reduces ambiguity

  > General dysfunction of the immune system at the leukocyte level **is suggested by** both animal and human studies.

  should be

  > Both human and animal studies **suggest** that **diabetics** have general immune dysfunction at the leukocyte level.

Passive voice should be used **sparingly and proposefully**.

- e.g. What is done is more important than who did it.

### 2.1. It’s OK to use "We" and "I"

- The active voice is livelier and easier to read.
- Avoiding personal pronouns **does not** make your science more objective.
- By agreeing to be an author on the paper, you are taking responsibility for its content. Thus, you should also claim responsibility for the assertions in the text by using “We” or “I”.


### 2.2. Use strong verbs

All "to be" verbs and weak verbs should be replaced.

"To be" verbs:

```
is, are, was, were, be, been, am, ...
```

Weak verbs:

```
come, move, report, provide, ...
```

- **Examples**

> Loud music **came** from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena **moved** as the hungry crowd got to its feet.

should be

> Loud music **exploded** from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena **shook** as the hungry crowd leaped to its feet.

and

> The WHO **reports that approximately** two-thirds of the world’s diabetics are found in developing countries, and **estimates** that the number of daibetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.

should be

> The WHO **estimates** that two-thrids of the world’s diabetics are found in developing countries, and **projects** that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.



### 2.3. Avoid turning verbs into nouns

Don’t kill verbs by turning them into nouns.

| Wrong                            | Right                  |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Obtain estimates of              | estimates              |
| Has seen an expansion in         | has expanded           |
| Provides a methodologic emphasis | emphasizes methodology |
| Take an assessment of            | assess                 |
| provide a review of              | review                 |
| offer confirmation of            | confirm                |
| make a decision                  | decide                 |
| shows a peak                     | peak                   |
| provide a description of         | describe               |

- **Examples**

> During DNA damage, **recognition** of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in **recruitment** of Sin3/HDAC and **repression** of cell proliferation genes.

should be

> During DNA damage, H3K4me3 **recruits** ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together **repress** cell proliferation genes.

### 2.4. Don’t bury the main verb

Keep the subject and main verb (predicate) close toigether at the start of the sentence.

Readers are waiting for the verb!

- **Examples**


```
One study ... (long sentence) found that ...
```

should be

```
One study found that, ...
```
